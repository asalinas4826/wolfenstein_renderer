# Wolfenstein-style software renderer
![screenshot](wolfenstein_render.png)
written with C and SDL2.

Heavily used https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html as a resource.
Also used https://github.com/jdah/doomenstein-3d/tree/main by jdh, but mostly just used his Makefile. I also used a macro or two of his, but most of my code is my own.

### Building and running
`$ make all` to build
`$ ./bin/wolf` to run
